	abstract = {The increasing complexity and dynamical property in stock markets are key challenges of the financial industry, in which inflexible trading strategies designed by experienced financial practitioners fail to achieve satisfactory performance in all market conditions. To meet this challenge, adaptive stock trading strategies with deep reinforcement learning methods are proposed. For the time-series nature of stock market data, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is applied to extract informative financial features, which can represent the intrinsic characteristics of the stock market for adaptive trading decisions. Furthermore, with the tailored design of state and action spaces, two trading strategies with reinforcement learning methods are proposed as GDQN (Gated Deep Q-learning trading strategy) and GDPG (Gated Deterministic Policy Gradient trading strategy). To verify the robustness and effectiveness of GDQN and GDPG, they are tested both in the trending and in the volatile stock market from different countries. Experimental results show that the proposed GDQN and GDPG not only outperform the Turtle trading strategy but also achieve more stable returns than a state-of-the-art direct reinforcement learning method, DRL trading strategy, in the volatile stock market. As far as the GDQN and the GDPG are compared, experimental results demonstrate that the GDPG with an actor-critic framework is more stable than the GDQN with a critic-only framework in the ever-evolving stock market.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm has been widely used in algorithmic trading. Many fully automated trading systems or strategies have been built using DRL agents, which integrate price prediction and trading signal generation in one system. However, the previous agents extract the current state from the market data without considering the long-term market historical trend when making decisions. Besides, plenty of related and useful information has not been considered. To address these two problems, we propose a novel model named Parallel Multi-Module Deep Reinforcement Learning (PMMRL) algorithm. Here, two parallel modules are used to extract and encode the feature: one module employing Fully Connected (FC) layers is used to learn the current state from the market data of the traded stock and the fundamental data of the issuing company; another module using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers aims to detect the long-term historical trend of the market. The proposed model can extract features from the whole environment by the above two modules simultaneously, taking the advantages of both LSTM and FC layers. Extensive experiments on China stock market illustrate that the proposed PMMRL algorithm achieves a higher profit and a lower drawdown than several state-of-the-art algorithms.},

	abstract = {In this article, we considered a risk-adjusted performance measure which benefits from a large success among the portfolio management community. Namely, Sharpe ratio considers the ratio of a given stock's excess return to its corresponding standard deviation. Excess return is commonly thought as a performance indicator whereas standard deviation is considered as a risk adjustment factor. However, such considerations are relevant in a stable setting such as a Gaussian world. Unfortunately, Gaussian features are scarce in the real world so that Sharpe performance measure suffers from various biases. Such biases arise from deviations from normality such as skewness and kurtosis patterns, which often exhibit the non-negligible weights of large and/or extreme return values. To bypass the potential biases embedded in Sharpe ratios, we propose a robust filtering method based on Kalman estimation technique so as to extract fundamental Sharpe ratios from their observed counterparts. Obtained fundamental Sharpe ratios are free of bias and exhibit a pure performance indicator. Results are interesting with regard to two findings. First, fundamental Sharpe ratios are obtained after removing directly the market trend impact whereas the kurtosis bias is removed at the volatility level. Second, fundamental Sharpe ratios exhibit a cross section dependency in the light of the well known size and book-to-market factors of Fama and French [1993]. Consequently, it is possible to extract pure performance and bias-free indicators, which are of primary importance for asset selection and performance ranking. Indeed, such concern is of huge significance given that the asset allocation policy, performance forecasts and cost of capital assessment, among others, are driven by performance indicators (Farinelli, Ferreira, Rossello, Thoeny, and Tibiletti [2008]; Lien [2002]; Christensen, and Platen [2007]).},

	abstract = {Financial markets are volatile and dynamic. The uncertainties involved in the market and various economic factors affect the asset price. Predicting trends in asset prices and calculating future value of an asset is a very challenging task. This is responsible for increased use of algorithmic trading amongst traders in financial markets. Algorithmic trading is a method of executing orders using pre-programmed automated trading instructions that consider asset variables including price and volume. Algorithmic trading is widely used in financial firms where large orders are executed and where humans take more time to respond. Algorithmic trading is also called black-box trading, automated trading, or Algo-trading. Algorithmic Trading uses the calculating powers of the computer. News or quotes are not sufficient to trade in financial markets. The challenges in trading can be reduced by proper analysis of data. Technical indicators consider the price and volume data of stock. These technical indicators together can be used to build trading strategies with calculated risks. This paper proposes trading strategies based on quantitative analysis of time series data. These strategies were developed for intraday high-profit trading. The strategy with RSI and MACD technical indicator gives the highest returns up to 12\%.},

	abstract = {Learning to store information over extended time intervals by recurrent backpropagation takes a very long time, mostly because of insufficient, decaying error backflow. We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},
